  about:
    "I'm an AI engineer based in Delhi, currently working as a Research Associate at Keywords Studios, where I run large-scale RLHF and human-in-the-loop evaluation on a frontier foundation LLM — tracing chain-of-thought reasoning, auditing multi-agent behavior, and hunting down the failure modes that separate a good model from a trustworthy one. Outside of work, I build the systems I evaluate: AdaptiveRAG, a production-grade hybrid retrieval pipeline benchmarked with real RAGAS scores, and FunnX.Ai, a multi-LLM chat platform. I graduated in Computer Science from MGM College in 2025, and I'm currently looking for my next role as a Python backend or AI/GenAI engineer — ideally one where I keep doing both: understanding how these systems fail, and building the ones that don't.",
